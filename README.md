### Description

There have been many XP Side Menu uploads recently, so I thought I would add my own. I believe it is the best yet. Nearly identical to the real Win XP Side Menus. Please let me know if you agree. I have to give credit to Marcel Jules. I started with his control and improved on it. I Apologize for not commenting my code.
